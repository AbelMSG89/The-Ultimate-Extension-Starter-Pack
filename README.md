# The Ultimate Extension Starter Pack

A curated extension pack intended as a general-purpose starter kit for any developer profile. This pack brings together commonly used tools to improve productivity, project management, Markdown editing, image previews and code navigation — useful for personal and professional workflows.

## Included Extensions

- `alefragnani.project-manager` — Manage multiple projects and workspaces from the sidebar. Quickly switch between folders and organize frequently used projects.

- `aaron-bond.better-comments` — Improve the readability of in-code comments by tagging notes as alerts, todos, highlights or info with colored annotations.

- `kisstkondoros.vscode-gutter-preview` — Display image previews directly in the editor gutter, handy when working with image file paths or visual assets.

- `alefragnani.Bookmarks` — Add and navigate bookmarks in your code to quickly jump to important lines or sections within large files.

- `adpyke.codesnap` — Capture stylish screenshots of code snippets for sharing in documentation, slides or social media.

- `codezombiech.gitignore` — Enhanced editing support for `.gitignore` files, including templates and autocomplete based on GitHub's collection.

- `donjayamanne.githistory` — Browse file and repository history, compare commits and explore changes with a visual history viewer.

- `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one` — A complete Markdown toolkit: shortcuts, preview, auto-completion, table of contents generation and more.

- `DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint` — Lint and enforce style rules for Markdown files to keep documentation consistent and clean.

## Quick Start

1. Install the pack from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace (search for "The Ultimate Extension Starter Pack" or publisher `AbelMSG89`).
2. Alternatively, install the generated `.vsix` locally with:

```powershell
code --install-extension 'path\to\the-ultimate-extension-starter-pack-0.0.1.vsix'
```

3. Restart VS Code if needed and configure each extension via Settings to match your workflow.

## Notes

- This repository is an extension pack that aggregates existing extensions; it does not add new editor features itself.
- If you want, I can add direct Marketplace links for each extension, a packaging script in `package.json` (e.g. `npm run package`), or CI steps to produce the `.vsix` automatically.
